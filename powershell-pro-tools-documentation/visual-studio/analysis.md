# Analysis

PowerShell Pro Tools uses PSScriptAnalyzer to run static code analysis of PowerShell scripts in Visual Studio. You can enable analysis by click View->PowerShell->Settings. Click Save after modifying the settings.&#x20;

On the options page, you can turn on and off script analyzer completely, manage solution wide analysis, disable specific severities or even specific rules.&#x20;

When Script Analyzer is enabled, squiggly lines will be present within source files to provide information on potential issues with the ability to provide quick fixes for those issues.&#x20;

If you have solution wide analysis enabled, you will be able to see errors within your entire solution within the Error List window.&#x20;

## Quick Fix

PowerShell Pro Tools supports quick fix actions provided by PSScriptAnalyzer. If the suggestion has a Suggested Correction, PowerShell Pro Tools will provide a Quick Action light bulb next to the line that needs to be addressed.&#x20;
